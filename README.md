# Display the results of get_preds() output from a fastai vision learner

### NOTE: I am not supporting this code, you get what you pay for!

I've tested this with 25 images and it renders OK, I can't comment on how it will handle more images than that.

* Make sure to include this Python file in the same folder as your Jupyter Notebook
* Example usage in the screenshot below, don't forget to use your own paths
* It does not have to be a learner loaded from a pickle file
* Incorrectly classified images will be displayed with a red dotted border
